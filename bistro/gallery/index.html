<h1>Blackstone Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram photo before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

<br>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>

People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>

Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Crispy Fried Chicken Fingers</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="yummy looking chickie fingies" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
For when the kids are fussy (or maybe the hubby!), a plate of classic deep-fried and seasoned chicken fingers can always be counted on to please the taste buds! Served with choice of sauce (yeah, ketchup, we know...). </p>

<h2>Seasoned Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="America's Frenchiest side" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Garlic and basil seasoned, and coated in olive oil- nobody said they were good for you, but we know you won't be able to resist these delicious fried potatoes once you sneak one from your friend when they aren't looking. Go ahead and order seconds- don't worry, we won't tell. </p>

<h2>Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabou.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="wtf is Tabouleh?" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
I am not really sure what this is or why it's on the menu, but... Apparently it's our chef's favorite, so who am I to argue? Order it and tell me how it tastes. Or maybe I can tell just by looking at your face when you try it...</p>
