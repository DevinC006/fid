    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i><em><dfn><b>sous vide</b></dfn></em></i>. In <i><em>sous vide</em></i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite><b>Cooking for Geeks</b></cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

    <p>Next month, we will be serving <i><em>sous vide</em></i> <i>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time=2016-11-30>November 30.</time></p>

    <p><small>Warning: <i><em>sous vide</em></i> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
